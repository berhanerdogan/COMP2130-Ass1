# 📚 Student Management Console App  

A simple **Java console application** for managing student records.  
This project allows you to:  

- ➕ **Add students** (undergraduate or graduate)  
- 📋 **List all students** with details like city, average grade, subject, and year  
- ❌ **Remove students** by ID  
- 🧮 **Calculate average grades** automatically

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (OOP principles – inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)  
- **Collections API** (ArrayList)
